                        Well, it's the last day of 2012, so I figured I'd do a year in review of my favorite pics from
                        theyear.

                    <p>What can I say, there's just too many to choose. I did have a lot of fun taking all these. This

                        that
                        puts me, but I was happy to be able to have another day like this on the top of</p>
